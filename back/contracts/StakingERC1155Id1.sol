     * @param _erc1155Contract The address of the Tokenize ERC1155 contract used for staking
     * @param _erc20Contract The address of the DiscountToken ERC20 contract used for rewards distribution
     * @dev Initializes the erc1155Contract and erc20Contract variables with the provided contract addresses
     * @dev This contract uses a fixed reward rate per second to control the generation of tokens. 
     * We want a user to generate 6 tokens over a period of 9 months. To achieve this, we need to set a certain 
     * reward rate per second. We start by determining the total number of seconds in 9 months which is approximately
     * 23,328,000 seconds (30 days/month * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 9 months).
     * To generate 6 tokens over this period, we divide the total number of tokens by the total number of seconds. 
     * This gives us a reward rate of 0.000000257201646090534 tokens per second (6 tokens / 23,328,000 seconds).
     * However, since we are dealing with Ethereum, we often perform calculations at a scale of 10^-18 for precision. 
     * So we multiply our reward rate by 10^18 to get our final reward rate per second in terms of wei (the smallest 
     * denomination of ether). This comes out to be approximately 257201 tokens per second at a scale of 10^-18 
     * (0.000000257201646090534 tokens/second * 10^18).
     * This means that with this reward rate, a user staking its tokens will generate approximately 6 tokens over 
     * a period of 9 months for each token staked.
